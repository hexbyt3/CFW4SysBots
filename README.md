## Setup Guide for Mod Chipped Switches

For Mariko/patched Switch models with mod chips installed, we provide a separate download package that includes Hekate bootloader.

### Step 1: Download Mod Chip Package

1. Download the separate package specially designed for mod chipped Switches
2. This package includes all the same files as the standard package plus Hekate bootloader

### Step 2: Copy Files to SD Card

1. Format your SD card to FAT32 using the included tool
2. Copy all contents from the `sd` folder to the root of your SD card
3. Safely eject the SD card from your computer

### Step 3: Boot Using Mod Chip

1. Insert your SD card into your Switch
2. Power on your Switch - the mod chip should automatically boot to Hekate
3. If it doesn't automatically boot, consult your mod chip's documentation for specific boot instructions

### Step 4: Launch Atmosphère

1. In the Hekate bootloader screen, navigate to "Payloads"
2. Select "fusee.bin" from the list
3. This will boot your Switch into Atmosphère with all required modules

## Initial Setup

1. The Switch will boot into Atmosphère custom firmware
2. Follow any on-screen prompts to complete initial setup
3. Atmosphère will automatically load sys-botbase and other required modules

## Connect to SysBot.NET

1. Launch your Pokémon game
2. Connect your Switch to the same network as your PC (via WiFi settings)
3. Note your Switch's IP address (found in System Settings → Internet → Connection Status)
4. Use this IP address to connect SysBot.NET from your PC

## Upgrading Existing Setup

When upgrading to a newer version of this package:

1. **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT delete the `Nintendo` folder on your SD card - it contains all your save data!
2. Copy the contents of the new `sd` folder to your SD card, overwriting existing files when prompted
3. Re-inject the payload using the updated `fusee.bin` if provided in the new package
4. Your saved data, configurations, and personal settings will remain intact

## Using JKSV (Save Manager)

JKSV lets you backup and restore game save files.

### Backing Up Saves:

1. Launch JKSV from the Homebrew Menu
2. Select the game you want to backup from the list
3. Press the + button or select "Backup" option
4. Enter a name for your backup (or use the default)
5. Wait for the backup to complete

### Restoring Saves:

1. Launch JKSV from the Homebrew Menu
2. Select the game you want to restore
3. Press Y to view your save backups
4. Select the backup you want to restore
5. Choose "Restore" and confirm
6. Restart your game to use the restored save

## Using FTPD Pro (File Transfer)

FTPD allows wireless file transfer between your PC and Switch.

### On Your Switch:

1. Launch FTPD Pro from the Homebrew Menu
2. The screen will display your Switch's IP address and port (usually 5000)
3. Leave FTPD Pro running during the entire transfer process

### On Your PC:

1. Download and install an FTP client like FileZilla
2. Open your FTP client and enter the connection details:
   - Host: Your Switch's IP address (shown on the FTPD screen)
   - Port: 5000 (or whatever is shown on the FTPD screen)
   - Username: (leave blank or try "anonymous")
   - Password: (leave blank)
3. Click "Connect" or "Quick Connect"
4. Once connected, you'll see your Switch's file system
5. You can now drag and drop files between your PC and Switch
6. When finished, disconnect from your FTP client before closing FTPD

Tips:
- Use FTP to add/update games and homebrew applications
- Navigate to `/atmosphere/contents/` to modify game mods
- You can transfer screenshots from `/Nintendo/Album/`

## Troubleshooting

- **Switch won't enter RCM**: Ensure your Switch is unpatched and the RCM jig is properly inserted
- **Payload injection fails**: Try reinstalling drivers or using a different USB cable
- **SysBot won't connect**: Verify your IP address and ensure your game is running
- **Black screen after injection**: Ensure you're using the correct fusee.bin file for your setup
- **Mod chip not booting**: Consult your mod chip documentation for specific troubleshooting steps
